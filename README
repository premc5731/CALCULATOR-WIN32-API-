# Calculator (Win32 API)

A simple, modern-looking calculator application built with the native Win32 API and C. This project serves as a practical example of creating a graphical user interface (GUI) from scratch without relying on higher-level frameworks like .NET or MFC. It demonstrates fundamental Win32 concepts such as window creation, message handling, and custom control styling.

## Features

- **Standard Arithmetic Operations**:
    - Addition (`+`)
    - Subtraction (`-`)
    - Multiplication (`*`)
    - Division (`/`)
    - Modulus (`%`)
- **Responsive Layout**: The button layout is calculated programmatically for a consistent look.
- **Custom Styling**: Uses GDI (Graphics Device Interface) to customize the colors of the display and buttons.
- **Lightweight Executable**: Because it's built directly on the Win32 API, the final application is small and fast with no external dependencies.

## Building the Project

This project is designed to be compiled with a C compiler like GCC (via MinGW on Windows) or the Microsoft Visual C compiler.

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., MinGW-w64 for GCC).
- The Windows SDK (usually included with compilers targeting Windows).

### Compilation with GCC (MinGW)

To compile the project from the command line, navigate to the directory containing the source code and run the following command:

```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calculator.exe -lgdi32
```
